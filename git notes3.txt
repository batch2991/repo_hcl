git diff filename -------- show the diff of file  between  working dir, staging
git diff --cached filename ---- show the diff of file bwt  staging, local rep
==============

git stash ---------------- all new changes in working dir will be moved to temp location.
            now "git status"   will be clean

git stash list ----------- display the stashnumber and changes 

git stash show  stashno ----------display the detailed files,changes moved to stash

git stash pop stashno ------------ will get back the updates from temp location
				to working dir

	now "git status"  changes not staged to commit..
============================
branches
--------------
	branches are used in parallel developments like multiple teams in the project can work on different branch and merge the code between branches later.

	by default all the files comitted will be in master branch.

	any updates can be done into the required branch we need and can differentiate the files
	between branches.

	git checkout -b newbranchname  master -------- to create a new branch from master
	git checkout -b b1 master ----------- creates a new "b1" branch from master
				and also check the focus to b1 branch

	git branch-------------- list all the branches available
	git checkout branchname ------------- to switch to the required branchname
	
	ex:
		git checkout b1 ------------- now focus is in b1 branch

		support if any files are created and committed will be in   b1 branch

		if we see the
			git log --oneline  b1
			git log --oneline master

			we can observe the differences

		
				
	git merge srcbranch  destbranch ------- to merge
	ex: git merge b1 master  -------------- will add the files into master from b1
				so master has  b1 branch files also.
